Node Banana is node-based workflow application for generating images with NBP. Build image generation pipelines by connecting nodes on a visual canvas. Built mainly with Opus 4.5.

## Features

- **Visual Node Editor** - Drag-and-drop nodes onto an infinite canvas with pan and zoom
- **Image Annotation** - Full-screen editor with drawing tools (rectangles, circles, arrows, freehand, text)
- **AI Image Generation** - Generate images using Google Gemini models
- **Text Generation** - Generate text using Google Gemini or OpenAI models
- **Workflow Chaining** - Connect multiple nodes to create complex pipelines
- **Save/Load Workflows** - Export and import workflows as JSON files

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 16 (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Node Editor**: @xyflow/react (React Flow)
- **Canvas**: Konva.js / react-konva
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **AI**: Google Gemini API, OpenAI API

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key  # Optional, for OpenAI LLM provider
```

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Build

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

## Example Workflows

The `/public/examples` directory contains some example workflow files from my personal projects. To try them:

1. Start the dev server with `npm run dev`
2. Drag any `.json` file from the `/public/examples` folder into the browser window
3. Make sure you review each of the prompts before starting, these are fairly targetted to the examples. 

## Usage

1. **Add nodes** - Click the floating action bar to add nodes to the canvas
2. **Connect nodes** - Drag from output handles to input handles (matching types only)
3. **Configure nodes** - Adjust settings like model, aspect ratio, or drawing tools
4. **Run workflow** - Click the Run button to execute the pipeline
5. **Save/Load** - Use the header menu to save or load workflows

## Connection Rules

- **Image** handles connect to **Image** handles only
- **Text** handles connect to **Text** handles only
- Image inputs on generation nodes accept multiple connections
- Text inputs accept single connections

## Contributions
PRs are welcome, please pull the latest changes from develop before creating a PR and make it to the develop branch, not master. Not that I'm primarily making this for my own workflows, if the PR conflicts with my own plans I'll politely reject it. If you want to collaborate, consider joining the Discord and we can hash something out.
